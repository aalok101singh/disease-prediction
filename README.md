# Disease-Prediction
An ANN Project to Predict Heart Disease Using Machine Learning and Streamlit to Build an End-To-End App.

## Overview
- Predicted Heart Disease using various machine learning algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression (LR)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)
  - Random Forrest Classifier (RFC)
 
- Achieved impressive testing accuracy:
  - Using the Logistic Regression (LR) Model, the Machine was able to Predict Heart Disease with an Accuracy of 85.86%.
